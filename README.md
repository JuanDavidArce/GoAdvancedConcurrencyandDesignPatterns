# Go Advanced Concurrencyand Design Patterns
In this repository we can find different design patterns implemented such as:
* adapter
* factory
* observer
* singleton
* strategy

All these implementations can be found in the design_patterns folder
We also have a chat in terminal which was developed using different concurrency techniques, this chat can be found in the net folder in the chat file, in this folder we can also find the port file which allows us to scan the ports that are open in a Web page

# Requirements
The only thing we need is to have go installed on our computer

## How to run it?
To run any file in the repository, just type the command go run file.go in the terminal
